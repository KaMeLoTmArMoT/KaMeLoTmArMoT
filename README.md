## 🧩 About me

I’m a Python ML engineer with ~3.5 years of commercial experience, focused on applied ML and production-friendly Computer Vision.
Currently building pet projects that help me practice, explore ideas, and stay sharp.

---

## 🔧 What I work with

- **ML/CV:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, TensorRT, CUDA
- **Backend:** FastAPI, asyncio, multiprocessing
- **Data & annotation:** Label Studio (workflows, exports, automation)
- **Ops:** Docker, Linux, Git, CI/CD
- **Robotics/sim:** Gazebo, Webots, basic ROS 2
- **Video:** GStreamer

---

## 🚀 Highlights

- End-to-end CV pipelines: data → annotation → training → export → deployment
- Semi-automated segmentation (SAM/FastSAM) to speed up labeling loops
- Simulation-based test scenarios for faster iteration and regression coverage
- On‑prem deployments: debugging, performance checks, hotfixes, data extraction
